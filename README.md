# 🏃🏿🏃‍♂️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃‍♀️ A simple but powerfull pace calculator for runners

### What's inside?

It's a PWA app that works even offline! So you can install to your phone desktop and it will look like a native app ;)

### What's been used?

* React
* React Context api
* React Router
* CRA (just got used to it, i know Vite is better, will use it next time)
* React Router
* MUI
* Service Workers for PWA and offline work
* my own math formulas for calculating pace and time since no libraries are good with time duration in general
